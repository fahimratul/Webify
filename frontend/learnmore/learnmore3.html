        <h3>1. Build a WEBIFY‑Ready Template or Component</h3>
        <p>
          Start by creating a reusable template or UI component that works well inside WEBIFY’s static export workflow.
          Use clean, semantic HTML, modular CSS, and minimal JavaScript so users can easily customize your work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure your design solves a real problem: portfolio sections, pricing tables, hero headers,
          contact forms, or full one‑page sites tend to perform well with creators.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="howto-card">
        <h3>2. Prepare Files and Documentation</h3>
        <p>
          Organize your code into a clear folder structure, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any assets such as images
          or icons. Keep file names simple and consistent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add a short <code>README.md</code> or <code>README.txt</code> that explains how to use the template,
          which sections can be edited, and any configuration options, so buyers can get started quickly.

        <h3>3. Submit Your Item to the Marketplace</h3>
        <p>
          Go to the <strong>Market</strong> section inside WEBIFY and click
          <strong>Add New Item</strong> (or a similar upload button) to start the submission process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upload your zipped project, provide a clear title, description, feature list,
          and a few screenshots or a live preview link so users can evaluate the quality before buying or downloading.
        </p>

      <article class="howto-card">
        <h3>4. Choose Pricing and License</h3>
        <p>
          Decide whether your item will be <strong>free</strong>, <strong>pay‑what‑you‑want</strong>,
          or a <strong>fixed price</strong>. Free items help you gain visibility; paid items help sustain your work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Select a license that matches your goals (for example, allowing personal use, commercial use,
          or open‑source reuse). Clearly mention any limits, so expectations are transparent for buyers.

      <article class="howto-card">
        <h3>5. Support Users and Ship Updates</h3>
        <p>
          After publishing, keep an eye on feedback, questions, and bug reports coming from marketplace comments
          or issue trackers linked from your item page.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you fix bugs or add improvements, upload a new version and include a short changelog.
          This builds trust and encourages repeat customers across your templates. [web:8][web:12]

      <article class="howto-card">
        <h3>6. Grow and Maintain the Community</h3>
        <p>
          Join the WEBIFY community spaces (forums, chat, or Git repository) to answer questions, share best practices,
          and help new users learn how to build with your components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contribute example projects, write short tutorials, and collaborate with other developers.
          A friendly, active presence makes your marketplace profile stronger over time. [web:8][web:12]
